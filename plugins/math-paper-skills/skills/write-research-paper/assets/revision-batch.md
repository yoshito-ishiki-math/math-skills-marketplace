## Source reviews

Copy verdicts literally. A writer does not infer `PASS` after making repairs.

| Review ID | Mode | Artifact | Exact reviewed revision | Literal verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | continuous | | | PASS \| FAIL \| INVALID |

## Finding coverage

Include every ranked finding, every distinct objective defect separately
stated in a synthesis, and every actionable editorial inventory item. Several
rows may map to one common-cause cluster. Do not make one cluster per journal
flag.

| Source finding ID | Evidence locator or journal entries | Cluster ID | Decision | Closure evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | implement \| modify \| reject \| defer | |

Every source finding ID appears exactly once. `Reject` requires exact textual
or audience-contract evidence. `Defer` is open and prevents a finished
checkpoint unless the owner explicitly excludes it. Before finishing, verify
that there are no orphan, duplicate, or open source findings.

Use one cluster entry per common cause, not per flag or sentence.
