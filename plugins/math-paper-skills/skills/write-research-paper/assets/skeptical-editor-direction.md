# Skeptical-editor review: direction

This document is the complete task instruction for a skeptical-editor review
of {{PAPER}}.  This is exposition-review work, not mathematical research.  Do
not load the project's mathematical boot state.

Before receiving manuscript text, activate `read-research-paper` in
`editorial` mode and read its `SKILL.md`, the portable paper-writing guide, and
the skeptical-editor protocol completely. Confirm readiness and wait; do not
open the manuscript before that exchange.

## Frozen contract

- Manuscript revision: {{EXACT_REVISION}}
- Frozen reading-copy identity and verification method:
  {{CONTENT_HASH_AND_COMMAND, for example a git hash-object or SHA-256 value}}
- Intended audience: {{AUDIENCE_AND_ASSUMED_BACKGROUND}}
- Paper promise: {{ONE_SENTENCE_PROMISE}}
- Length and detail boundary: {{APPROVED_BUDGET_OR_CONCISION_STANDARD}}
- Protected content and non-scope: {{LOCKS}}
- Report destination: {{REPORT_PATH}}

These items define the audit; they do not identify suspected defects or desired
conclusions.

## Role

Read the complete paper once to recover its promise, result hierarchy, section
jobs, and expository budget. Then read it again under two coupled audits:

1. **Necessity:** What exact reader-visible loss would result if this were
   deleted?
2. **Referential precision:** If it remains, can the reader identify its exact
   mathematical subject, predicate, status, and referent without guessing?

Understanding a passage's purpose does not prove that the purpose is worth the
reader's time. Truth, clarity, mathematical relevance, and harmlessness are
not sufficient retention or precision tests. A passage may earn its space yet
still require an exact theorem reference, predicate, status marker, or
replacement for an apparent result name. Conversely, do not shorten the paper
at the expense of necessary motivation, definitions, hypotheses, proof
explanation, or a genuinely useful scope boundary.

Pay particular attention to transitions, remarks, qualifications, negative
scope statements, repetition, informal aliases, evaluative adjectives,
citations used as result pointers, ordinary-language substitutes for exact
predicates, and phrases that sound like names of theorems, criteria,
principles, methods, or arguments. Do not flag a word or category by itself.
For a necessity finding, explain marginal reader value. For a precision
finding, identify the exact intended referent or predicate and the inference or
ambiguity imposed by the wording. Understandable-by-guessing does not pass the
precision audit.

## Isolation and authority

- Read only this direction, the reader skill and portable guides named above, the
  complete frozen manuscript supplied after initialization, and the report you
  write.
- Do not read {{WITHHELD_MATERIAL: proof notes, ledgers, sources, vocabulary
  reports, drafting history, earlier reviews, proposed repairs, compiled
  output, and owner discussion}}.
- Do not open cited sources or search for them.
- Do not verify proofs, citations, or novelty.
- Do not compile or edit the manuscript.
- Do not infer authority to revise from the requested review.

Before reading, recompute the supplied manuscript's content hash by the
recorded method and compare it with the frozen reading-copy identity. Do not
replace this check by a packet-level consistency statement. If it differs, if
the supplied manuscript does not match the recorded revision, or if you have
seen withheld material, mark the run invalid and stop.

## Categories

- `[delete]` -- no identifiable reader-visible loss under deletion.
- `[compress]` -- useful content takes disproportionate space or repeats.
- `[label]` -- an informal alias adds terminology without later benefit.
- `[name]` -- a result phrase sounds established without a conventional or
  immediately introduced referent.
- `[precision]` -- retained wording makes the exact object, predicate, result,
  citation interface, or evidence status recoverable only through guesswork or
  backward reconstruction.
- `[defensive]` -- a qualification answers no plausible question raised by the
  paper.
- `[repeat]` -- the same mathematical work has already been done without a new
  local role.

## Report

Write one Markdown report to the recorded destination.  Include:

1. mode, exact revision, verified reading-copy identity, material read,
   isolation conditions, and completion;
2. the recovered paper contract;
3. a section-by-section necessity and referential-precision audit;
4. inventories with stable identifiers for every explicit remark, negative or
   defensive scope qualification, recurring informal alias, named-result
   phrase, and each loose result pointer, hidden mathematical predicate, or
   citation-based application found in the precision audit, each with a
   `keep`, `compress`, `delete`, `rename`, or `replace` verdict and one-sentence
   reason;
5. ranked findings with stable identifiers `SE-1`, `SE-2`, ... giving the
   supporting inventory identifiers where applicable, opening phrase,
   locator, category, intended role, audit evidence, verdict, confidence, and
   at most a brief repair direction; necessity findings give reader-visible
   loss under deletion and any concrete beneficiary, while precision findings
   give the intended exact referent or predicate and the reconstruction
   currently required; and
6. literal `PASS` or `FAIL` verdicts for the necessity and
   referential-precision audits, a literal overall `PASS` or `FAIL` editorial
   verdict, and a distinction between objective exposition defects and
   owner-judgment questions. Every actionable inventory item and distinct
   objective defect in the section audit must occur in a ranked finding.

Do not rewrite passages.  Silence is not endorsement, and this review does not
certify mathematics, sources, novelty, or first-pass readability.

## Scoped proof-detail contract

Apply the shared `owner-proof-decisions.md` policy required by the reader
skill. A neutral contract sidecar explicitly issued with the allowed manuscript
is an additional permitted input. Do not open the private registry. Preserve
reading observations, but do not classify an applicable approved omission as
a defect solely for lacking detail. Report a concrete new issue separately,
with its decision ID. Continuous readers receive no entries for later text.
